## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### First-Time Load (Render Free Tier)
- Backend may take 30-60 seconds on first request
- It "wakes up" from sleep
- Subsequent requests are instant

### What to Tell Your Boss:
"The first page load might take a minute as the free backend server wakes up. After that, everything is instant. For production, we'd use a paid tier ($7/month) with no delays."

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Resume upload not working?
1. Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Wait for backend to fully deploy (5-10 min)

### GitHub Pages showing 404?
1. Check Actions tab: https://github.com/surajikf/Recruit-Suite-for-Remote-Recruitment/actions
2. Make sure workflow completed successfully
3. Try changing Pages source to `/frontend/dist` if `/` doesn't work

### CORS errors in browser console?
1. Backend CORS is already configured
2. Make sure VITE_API_URL secret matches your actual Render URL
3. Rebuild: Go to Actions ‚Üí Re-run workflow
